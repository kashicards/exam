## Example Discussion

**Topic:** Should school uniforms be mandatory?

---

**Introduction:**
> Nowadays, the idea of mandatory school uniforms is a controversial topic. Some believe it fosters equality, while others argue it restricts personal freedom. In the following, I will discuss the pros and cons of school uniforms.

**Main Body:**
> Firstly, school uniforms can create a sense of community and reduce peer pressure. When students wear the same clothes, social differences become less visible, which can lead to a better learning environment.
>
> Moreover, uniforms can save time and money. Students do not need to worry about daily outfit choices or expensive fashion trends.
>
> On the other hand, critics argue that school uniforms limit individuality and self-expression. Teenagers, especially, want to develop their identity, and clothing is one important way of doing so.
>
> Furthermore, the cost of buying uniforms can be a financial burden for some families, especially if children grow quickly and uniforms need to be replaced often.

**Conclusion:**
> To sum up, both sides offer valid arguments. However, I believe that the benefits of wearing school uniforms outweigh the disadvantages. Uniforms promote equality and focus on education, which should be the main priority in schools.
